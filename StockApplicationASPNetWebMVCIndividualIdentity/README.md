TODO List:

1. Add shortlist was failing on live site and I had to go outside testing to fix it, figure out why
2. Look into IUnitOfWork more, and repository pattern, I'm CERTAIN its not implemented correctly here
3. Add more domain/functionality (cause there isn't much here)
4. Add Stripe subscription service to this


Desired App Behaviour

1. Able to shortlist stocks
2. Can dynamically configure/selected metrics
3. Called "Filtering Rules"? Able to filter stocks based on some criteria, 
for example (from a dividends book)
   1. The dividend has increased 5x in 12 years
   2. S&P Quality ranks the stock in the "A" category
   3. There are a least 5,000,000 shares outstanding
   4. There are at least 80 insutitional investors
   5. The company has at least 25 years of uninteruptted dividends
   6. Earnings have improved in at least 7 of 12 years
