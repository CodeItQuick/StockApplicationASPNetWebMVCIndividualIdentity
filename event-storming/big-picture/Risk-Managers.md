From the risk manager's point of view, the process of picking a stock involves several key events focused on assessing and mitigating potential risks associated with the investment. Here are the detailed events:

1. **Initial Risk Screening**:
    - **Preliminary Risk Assessment**: Conducting an initial assessment of the stock based on broad risk factors such as market volatility, sector-specific risks, and financial stability.
    - **Historical Performance Review**: Analyzing the stock’s historical performance to identify patterns of high volatility, drawdowns, and other risk indicators.

2. **Detailed Risk Analysis**:
    - **Financial Risk Evaluation**: Examining the company's financial health by reviewing debt levels, liquidity ratios, and other financial metrics.
    - **Operational Risk Assessment**: Assessing risks related to the company’s operations, including management effectiveness, operational efficiency, and supply chain stability.
    - **Market Risk Analysis**: Evaluating the stock's sensitivity to market movements, interest rate changes, and economic cycles.
    - **Regulatory Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential regulatory and compliance risks that could impact the company’s operations and financial performance.

3. **Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis**:
    - **Scenario Analysis**: Performing scenario analysis to understand how different economic, market, and operational scenarios could impact the stock’s performance.
    - **Sensitivity Analysis**: Conducting sensitivity analysis to evaluate how changes in key variables (e.g., interest rates, exchange rates) could affect the stock’s valuation and risk profile.

4. **Risk Metrics Calculation**:
    - **Value-at-Risk (VaR)**: Calculating the Value-at-Risk to estimate the potential loss in the stock’s value over a given time period under normal market conditions.
    - **Stress Testing**: Conducting stress tests to assess how the stock would perform under extreme market conditions or adverse events.

5. **Risk Report Preparation**:
    - **Comprehensive Risk Report**: Preparing a detailed risk report that includes findings from the risk assessments, scenario analysis, and stress tests.
    - **Risk Factors Summary**: Summarizing key risk factors and their potential impact on the stock’s performance.

6. **Collaboration with Analysts and Portfolio Managers**:
    - **Risk Communication**: Communicating risk assessment findings to research analysts and portfolio managers to ensure they are aware of the potential risks associated with the stock.
    - **Risk Mitigation Discussions**: Participating in discussions with analysts and portfolio managers to explore risk mitigation strategies and address any concerns.

7. **Risk Mitigation Strategy Development**:
    - **Hedging Strategies**: Recommending hedging strategies (e.g., options, futures) to protect against adverse price movements or other identified risks.
    - **Diversification**: Advising on diversification strategies to spread risk across different assets, sectors, and geographies.

8. **Approval Process Participation**:
    - **Investment Committee Review**: Presenting risk assessments to the investment committee and participating in discussions to ensure that all risks are considered before making investment decisions.
    - **Approval or Rejection**: Providing a risk-based perspective to support the approval or rejection of the stock pick.

9. **Post-Investment Monitoring**:
    - **Ongoing Risk Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring the stock and the company for new or evolving risks.
    - **Regular Updates**: Providing regular risk updates to portfolio managers and other stakeholders to inform them of any changes in the risk profile.
    - **Reevaluation**: Periodically reevaluating the stock’s risk profile based on new information, financial results, and market conditions.

10. **Reporting and Documentation**:
    - **Risk Reporting**: Preparing periodic risk reports that summarize the risk status of the stock and any changes in its risk profile.
    - **Documentation**: Maintaining detailed documentation of all risk assessments, analyses, and mitigation strategies for compliance and review purposes.

These events form a comprehensive process that risk managers follow to ensure that all potential risks associated with picking a stock are thoroughly assessed, communicated, and managed.
